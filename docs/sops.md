# Change SOPS recipients

Use this guide to add or remove a machine that can decrypt this repository's
secrets.

Every public key in `keys/` can decrypt every file in `secrets/`. The
`sops-rekey` recipe writes `.sops.yaml` from those public keys and updates the
recipient metadata in each secret.

## Add a recipient

1. Add the recipient's SSH public key to `keys/`.

   Use `aly_<host>.pub` for Aly's user key. Use `root_<host>.pub` for a host
   root key.

2. Regenerate the SOPS policy and recipient metadata.

   ```sh
   just sops-rekey
   ```

3. Review the generated policy and encrypted metadata. Do not print decrypted
   secret values.

   ```sh
   git diff -- .sops.yaml secrets
   ```

4. Verify that SOPS can decrypt every secret with your current key.

   ```sh
   for secret in secrets/*.yaml; do
     sops --decrypt "$secret" >/dev/null
   done
   ```

## Remove a recipient

1. Confirm that the machine no longer needs access to `secrets/`.

2. Remove the matching public key from `keys/`.

3. Run `just sops-rekey`.

4. Review the policy and secret metadata as in the add-recipient procedure.

Never add a private key to this repository.
